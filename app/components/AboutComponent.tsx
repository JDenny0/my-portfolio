							Hello! I am Denis Jakubec, a passionate photographer with three
							years of experience in creating unforgettable images that tell
							stories. In my photography practice, I enjoy experimenting with
							different techniques and approaches. My wedding photography style
							comprises classic elegance, modern techniques, and romantic
							depictions. A wedding is one of the most special moments in life,
							and my goal is to capture every moment of that day in a way that
							allows you to remember the emotions and joy. I believe that the
							key lies in attention to detail, flexibility, and the ability to
							adapt to different situations. I strive to document every
							important moment, from the pivotal moments of the ceremony to
							spontaneous and genuine emotions.

							whileInView='show'
							viewport={{ once: false, amount: 0.2 }}
							className='text-white italic text-center lg:text-left mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl'>
							Although I am still in the development phase, every project and
							every moment I capture is an opportunity for me to learn and grow.
							Whether Iâ€™m working on portraits, landscapes, or commercial
							photography, I always focus on creating an image that will exceed
							expectations and remain etched in memory.
